    <h1>hello there!</h1>
    <p>the site's under construction atm (with a couple of updates here and there), so come here later on</p>
    <p>hopefully it'll be done by then</p>
    <p>in the meantime, you can drop me a line at rozina@56k.email</p>

    <h2>about me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>i'm new to all this html stuff</li>
      <li>i find it really intriguing tbh</li>
      <li>i came along in 2001, so i never really had the chance to explore the original geocities sites as they happened</li>
      <li>i'm pretty much reliving this nostalgia that happened just before i existed</li>
      <li>i just wanna revive the web 1.0 aesthetic since all of the websites these days seem so darn boring and they all look the same</li>
    </ul>
